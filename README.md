- A timer starts when a user clicks the "Start" button
- The user is presented with a series of multiple-choice questions 
- As soon as the user answers a question, the next question is presented 
- When the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer

- The user is then able to enter his/hers initials and save the score 
- The user can view the initials and score of a user who previously saved their score
